# Scratchpad
Scratchpad is a collection of either experimental projects that challenge me outside of my comfortable zone, or projects that I no longer found the fun factor in doing it.

* [Hotland](https://github.com/Florastamine/Scratchpad/tree/master/Hotland) - A framework for subsystem initialization, logging, I/O, serialization, MT, Unicode and bootstrapping engine for applications, specifically game engines.
    * [Hotland](http://undertale.wikia.com/wiki/Hotland) is the volcanic area presented in the video game [Undertale](https://undertale.com/).

* [Herbal](https://github.com/Florastamine/Scratchpad/tree/master/Herbal) - A LuaJIT-, imgui- based minimal and simple wrapper over Urho3D's CMake build system.
    * The name "Herbal" stems from a [type of tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal_tea).
