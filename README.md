# Scratchpad
Scratchpad is a collection of either experimental projects that challenge me outside of my comfortable zone, or projects that I no longer found the fun factor in doing it.

* [Hotland](https://github.com/Florastamine/Scratchpad/Hotland) - A framework for subsystem initialization, logging, I/O, serialization, MT, Unicode and bootstrapping engine for applications, specifically game engines.
* [Herbal](https://github.com/Florastamine/Scratchpad/Herbal) - A LuaJIT-, imgui- based minimal and simple wrapper over Urho3D's CMake build system.
